Title : Vatah the Wind God
<br><br>

<br><br>
Vatah was a god from another sun region. They were new here, no god in this sun region had ever seen them before. But there was no surprise since it could happen from time to time, about once in a hundred sun cycles. Which meant a hundred times the sun had formed and died. Even so, it wasn’t that special about how they came and why. For some gods it wasn’t that long and they just fell into place in a natural way.
<br><br>
Back in the former region, Vatah was a formless god, the only being that had an ability to wander from region to region, like a seed that could fly with the wind. When they arrived, the gods barely knew there was a newcomer. Until Vatah’s ground cycle came and they reincarnated as a human. Then their existence was more understandable, gods saw a bright giant meteor falling from above, passing the floor where they lived and down to the ground. 
<br><br>
Some even thought a special one came down to help people. For Vatah, it’s more like people had their ridiculous moments, and gods like them were no exception. They were just falling off their bed while sleeping and ended up waking up in confusion. They didn't even know who they were. Time in the formless realm was absurdly long. All one could remember was a peaceful darkness. They had to restore and restart their senses again. And that was how Vatah had spent their human time, doing nothing but relearning. Just a plain person had come and gone unnoticed, like a whisper of wind.
<br><br>
Things went the same way when they were above. Humans barely knew or worshiped this kind of god, as they rarely interfered with people. What these gods produced was far beyond human understanding, yet many gods would have died for their by-products. They were like gods of gods even when they didn’t mean to. They just minded their own businesses and tried to let people be. But the people who could know of their existences tried to reach them anyway. 
<br><br>
By isolating themselves, it wasn’t like they weren’t interested in people, but rather that they had lived long enough to understand one thing: at the end of the day, there was no point in interfering. In most cases, silence was the best they could offer. 
<br><br>
For the time being, their existences weren't meant for granting wishes, — directly. To answer wishes, it was solely the act of nature. What these gods did was provide nourishment and enhance supplies. Fruits from a wild tree might not satisfy people as fruits from a farm. And these farmers were there to produce, rather than to consume. Besides, it was wise to give their by-products only to those who deserved them. 
<br><br>
In Vatah’s vision, the universe was like a large sheet of paper, dotted with millions of water droplets. Each dot represented a system that contained beings. All could be seen as stars and their regions, while the paper represented the space of unwillingness. In contrast to the paper, the water emerged from wishes and could only be moved by wish. Each wish had its own path and might conflict with the others. But they intuitively bound themselves together, knowing deep down that this was the only way they would finally get what they wished for. They sorted things out, formed order and ultimately created willing areas upon the unwilling space. 
<br><br>
In this sense, nothing was above nature. All one could perceive, living things, trees, rain, wind, or the earth, were parts of the flow of all wishes —nature. So basically, if one said they wanted to overcome nature, it would mean the lone individual was craving a fight against millions. That’s why learning its way and adapting through the process was more practical than simply withstanding the river and wearing oneself out over time. 
<br><br>
Vatah learnt the way of nature by seeing things as it be, not as it should. Air was something people couldn’t see but could feel its existence. Once an individual could see through the flow, they just needed a slight touch, and things could flow flawlessly or completely be a deadlock. With those abilities, Vatah became a wind god. One of the gods who wielded fundamental elements of the universe. The gods who knew they were just parts of it, but never the flow itself. Like how a toolsmith might create hammers, not metal nor wood. The one and only entity capable of creating such things was nature — the world itself. 
<br><br>
Unlike other kinds of elements, people barely noticed the existence of Vatah’s by-products. It was too light and too general, like some space people could use. Something people didn't feel the need until they felt uncomfortable. It could be used to breathe, to lighten something up, or to let something be. Once people had a chance to try, they would know how good it was to have some fresh air. 
<br><br>
In general, this god wasn’t that important. Their existence barely changed a thing. People could live perfectly fine without them. But somehow, it would be more pleasant if a sun region had a god like them.
