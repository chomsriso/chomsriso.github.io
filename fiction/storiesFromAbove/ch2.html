Title : Ratra and Their Night Time <br>
<br>
—<br>
<br>
It was dark and quiet when no sun presented. Just themself, their family and neighborhood. A celestial sentinel like Ratra had not much to do in this night time. No ground was found, the liveliness was absent. Remnants of life scattered across the region, the dead sun region. Only places like theirs and above, the deep opposite side and the farthest ring were still standing. It was sad to see but something had to be done. Otherwise, the whole region couldn’t stand and no life would ever occur. 
<br><br>
The universe was the place to make all the wishes come true, including the bad one. It took time, not instantly but eventually. The night time was for those who suffered and wished all to be gone. Ratra and other survivors had no relevance to these sufferings, so the destructive wishes could not reach them. They were just sitting there and out of the context. 
<br><br>
Ratra sighed softly. This night was longer than the day before sunset, due to the extreme conditions. Too much relevance could cause a windstorm and lead to more devastating damage than a firestorm, which was the least severe, or a rainstorm which was in the middle. Anyway there was nothing to be blamed for, since that was the reason people were up to and also the reason the universe went on. Even Ratra themself had their own reason, watching. Otherwise they wouldn’t be here in the first place. 
<br><br>
With time like eternal in hand, it couldn’t be helped but wondered if there was a kind of storm that had more damage than this. There wouldn't be any witness left to see and no one would ever know about it — except for the people from other regions. So Ratra looked up, stared at those gazillion regions all over the sky..
<br><br>
Some were shining, some were dark. Some were burning, some were drowned. Some were just like them, some were freshly formed. And yes, some were dying. A soon to be ex region was being eaten up by a snowstorm. All were broken into pieces and down to the road, ready to be pulled in by whatever region out there, or gathering up with others to form a new one. 
<br><br>
The cause of action was unknown. Even Ratra was left in awe, how things even went that south — or might be north? Maybe the number of wishes left in that region was too low. So, it couldn’t stand and had to disband to find or form a new home. 
<br><br>
.. Either way, knowing that changed nothing. People still went their ways no matter what. Ratra seemed to conclude their mind and moved on. Just what was offered here was enough to occupy someone and keep them busy. 
<br><br>
Now, it was time for a watcher like Ratra to give a touch to the dead sun. This kind would let no light escape once its prey passed a certain point, Ratra called it “the great dung”. It would take quite a while before it lost all its energy, loosened up, and decomposed, giving matter back to fertilize the poor soil around. And once that soil was enriched, it would bear a new sun and ground, then people could celebrate the vibrancy again. 
<br><br>
Merely a glance, Ratra knew something was slightly off. They went inside, touched a single speck of dust, and things got stuck even more. That was how it should have been at midnight like this, to fasten the process, opposite to the day time when things should have flowed smoothly. Despite that, their effort didn’t make much of a difference, but it was worth killing their time. Like one would go out and sweep some dead leaves off their yard.
