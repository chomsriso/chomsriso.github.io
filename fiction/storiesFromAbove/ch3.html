Title : Nillah the Black Beast
<br><br>

<br><br>
Black was not a popular color when it came to celestial bodies. People saw it as a downside, like a shadow. Yet, that was exactly why she chose to wear it.
<br><br>
Nillah was a daughter of a couple of gods. Her parents were known by many names, depending on the role at the moment. Unlike the rest of her family and most of the people up there, she had a gender. One of many traits that belonged to the worlds below. To her parents, she was like a reminder of earth, helping them stay humble, and lasting a sense of empathy. 
<br><br>
When Nillah’s parents adopted her, she just climbed up from the underworld, losing her way and how she would like to be. All she knew was surviving. Little by little, in such a lovely home, she gradually came to her senses. By being loved she could feel the love. Then she knew what love was and intuitively wanted to return the favor, to love them back. After all, she actually was a good girl. Otherwise, she wouldn’t do that, no matter how much love she got. That was why the universe gave her parents to her as a gift. And the same went to her parents, they had a good girl like her.
<br><br>
Her parents taught her as much as she could understand. Gave what she could take, in hope she could live a happy life. Now she grew big and there was nothing to worry about. She could recall what she was born for. A simple idea, to have a family, to share love with them, just like how her parents had shared with her. 
<br><br>
Most people believed that human-like beings were better than animal-like beings. But for celestial beasts, it was not. Their minds were so simple and straightforward. It would have been too complicated and frustrating for them to live like humans. With their high moralities, they could even be better than many human-like beings. Even for gods, it was wise to judge nothing out of these beasts. 
<br><br>
Nillah and her pack guarded what she saw dear to her. Even though her parents had better protections and required no protection from her. Her parents and their belongings were still precious to her, so she guarded them no matter what. But since no one could come in the area in the first place, her parents sometimes made her team guarding something somewhere else, or occasionally offered them as mercenaries. So their time could be put to use and yield some benefits for themselves. 
<br><br>
For Nillah, she saw black as a good color to blend in the shadow. She liked it when no one was expecting her. And when she appeared in broad daylight, she would have an intimidating look. This helped her scare people away and made her job easier. Besides, only a few could see through her true beauty. She loved it that way. It was more manageable for her when she only had a few to handle.
<br><br>
Contrasting to her sibling, Dipa the red flash, who was born to make the world a better place. They did love the spotlight because the spotlight made them rich. And when they were rich they could have significant resources to do their things. Dipa also came to her parents in a very different way. They emerged from the milky ocean, the remnants from the past night. This thing could be churned to randomize something out of it, whether beings or tools. The possibilities also depended on the doers and their wishes. In this case, a child that had some parts like their parents. So the world could give the karma back to them, both good and bad. It was funny they could see how annoying they were through this kid. 
<br><br>
Nillah never understood Dipa, why they had to do such— stupid things. All she saw was Dipa doing nothing but spinning around their head. She also noticed how often their parents frowned at them, raised an eyebrow, had a headache, or simply were left in awe. They, of course, supported Dipa in learning their way through the world. But in the meantime, unexpected things could be expected. She guessed that was how being parental meant and ignored any other details. Since she didn’t want to waste her time, her eyes, or her ears watching anymore of these stupidities. Anyway, when it came to her parents, she undoubtedly understood their behavior. It was their way to express their love for the world. And she wholeheartedly wanted to help them.
<br><br>
That’s how her parents’ backyard was filled with a group of black beasts, lying around comfortably, and when the time came, they all were ready to serve.
