Title : A Librarian and a Hidden Tree
<br><br>
—
<br><br>
Almost 400 sun cycles had passed since a librarian owned this library, where knowledge from across the entire sun region was stored peacefully. Books had been shared among the gods, though some knowledge couldn’t pass through if the reader couldn’t understand the idea. And, that was their problem. The librarian had already provided what a librarian should provide, their job was done there. 
<br><br>
Every book on the shelf was carefully picked and collected by the librarian, all were placed into perfect categories— except for those in the back room. There were many books in storage, but only a few could be useful. The rest were stuffed into a messy, cluttered pile, cloaked in dust. Despite that, those books were valuable to the owner. It had always been their strategy to hide something. The room didn’t need to be hidden or locked, people didn’t bother with things that looked worthless anyway. The librarian only had to be concerned if there was any tidy person nearby, especially the kind who would feel the urge to dump unsatisfactory things out of their sight.
<br><br>
From time to time, the librarian would close the library for a journey, searching for some new books. Even though they could divide themself into more, this was their way of living. They just chilled out and made no hurry. Everything could wait, even if it was a trip for a back room book. If something couldn’t wait and the sun’s region would collapse, so be it. The world never revolved around someone, but the other way around. It could stand or collapse on its own. A few people or a few acts changed nothing. 
<br><br>
There was also a branch of a big tree lying in front of the library. The tree stood tall from the bottom to the top of the sun region. Surprisingly, most people didn’t see it despite how gigantic it was. People went on with their lives as if the tree had never existed. Sometimes the librarian thought the tree was an illusion that only they could see. Until there was someone showing up and noticing the branch, which occasionally happened once in a while.
<br><br>
The tree was real. It wasn’t hidden, just invisible to most people. 
<br><br>
People believed what they wanted to believe, they saw only what they wanted to see. If they believed in living, then the tree shouldn’t be in their sight, even if it was right in front of their eyes. The reason was simple, its benefits didn’t interest them. 
<br><br>
The purpose of the tree was straight forward, to dissolve the soul, to set people free, and release them into the unwilling space. Only a few would seek it, for it was the opposite of what they had become. What kind of living thing would want to be a nonliving thing? It was the kind that had enough and no longer cared about their existence. There was always a price that living things must pay for their lives. Someone simply didn’t want to pay it anymore and resigned from existence.
<br><br>
By connecting to the tree for a certain amount of time, the objective should be done. The participant would feel no time nor themself. It's actually not that hard. The hardest part was their own intention. If the survival instinct kicked in and even the slightest hesitation came up, the process would be paused. Sometimes they didn’t know why they couldn’t reach the finish line, the key was right beneath their skin. They still thought like the living and weren’t meant for the unwilling space yet. 
<br><br>
The librarian also planted some bonsai from the branch, and placed it around the human world. Just in case someone happened to get interested, they would be able to access it more easily. 
<br><br>
By the way, the librarian only had the branch for collection. They planned not to fully use it. Since they knew they’d come back to do the exact same thing anyway, why bother going out? They decided to live in between, which was theoretically impossible. But they were happy with the way they lived now.
